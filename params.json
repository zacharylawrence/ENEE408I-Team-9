  "body": "## Project Overview\r\nThe goal of ENEE408I is to work in a group of 3 students to produce a fully autonomous robot capable of completing a small task and communicating with other robots. We constructed the frame of our robot using wood, plastic parts and legos. We then outfitted the frame with 2 motors, a servo, 3 IR sensors, a ping sensor and a pixy camera. We communicated with all of these sensors though an Arduino Uno and Raspberry Pi 2. Inserting a WiFi dongle into the Raspberry Pi enabled us to utilize wireless communication between robots to coordinate actions. The WiFi dongle also allowed us a host a web page on the Raspberry Pi that would allow for remote control of the robot through a browser.\r\n\r\n## Additional Information\r\nOur paper on the project: <br />\r\nOur GitHub page: <https://github.com/zacharylawrence/ENEE408I-Team-9><br />\r\nYouTube video: <https://youtu.be/JHeIsZMsnAo><br />\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\nThe creators of this project are Zachary Lawrence (@zacharylawrence), Paul “Nick” Laurenzano (@nicklaurenzano) and David Lim (@davidalim).\r\n\r\n## License Information\r\nMIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 Zachary Lawrence, Paul Laurenzano, David Lim\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
